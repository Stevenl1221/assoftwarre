                                    Our ultrasound unit, serving one of the busiest obstetrical units in Manhattan, performs over 25,000 scans and procedures a year and has been utilizing the AS reporting and archiving system since 2003. Everything in this reporting system is geared towards helping the physician generate a detailed, comprehensive, clear and organized report in a minimum amount of time and with a minimum amount of effort. It is a surprisingly user-friendly system, both from the perspective of our sonographers that enter the basic data as well as our MFM specialists that edit the reports. Almost every aspect of the report has been easily customized to suit our specific needs and preferences, and we are easily able to continuously tweak various aspects of the report according to our needs.
                                </p>
                                <p class="ssize">
                                    In a unit such as our own, where over 100 reports are generated daily, you don't want to spend time on a cumbersome reporting system. The AS system has turned the task of creating a report into an effortless task, where a few keystrokes are often all that is necessary to complete the job. The image viewing system is fast and efficient, and the file archiving system is simple and straightforward. In addition, the system allows us to generate a wide range of statistical reports as well as detailed searches for the purpose of research. In the rare cases that we have had a technical issue or problem to resolve, the support staff in AS has been extremely responsive and helpful. In short, it is not difficult to understand why we love using the AS system, and why our referring physicians love the clarity and the layout of the reports they receive.

                                    I rarely give product endorsements; however, my recommendation for AS Software is an exception. In 2006 we purchased the AS software system for our large Maternal Fetal Medicine unit where we saw over 17,000 patient visits last year. Prior to utilizing AS Software we were generating paper ultrasound reports that required several days to get into the hands of referring physicians due to editing and mailing.                                </p>
                                <p class="ssize">
                                    Since we have been using the AS Software system our work efficiency and productivity have changed dramatically. Our reports are generated on the spot and faxed immediately upon signing. Physicians can edit and sign the reports on an ongoing basis throughout the day rather than waiting for sonographers to generate and edit them between patients and after office hours. Referring physicians appreciate fast, easy access to faxed reports usually on the same day as the ultrasound. The image review feature allows us to compare prior and present scans easily and quickly. The antepartum testing reports and Message feature provide a comprehensive paperless reporting solution. The ongoing phone support from the AS Software personnel has been superb.                                </p>
                                <p class="ssize">
                                    I highly recommend the AS Software package to anyone who wants an easy and effective paperless solution with great client support.</p>

                                    I have worked with several ultrasound data collection, processing, and reporting programs over many years. The AS-OBGYN program is the most user-friendly and yet comprehensive and satisfying I have encountered. Data input is reliable, handling is easy, and reporting and billing processes are facilitated with minimal delay and maximal flexibility for the user. Querying of stored data is fairly easy and documentation of effort possible. AS Software's support staff is accessible and updating is timely and centralized for minimal intrusion into the work flow. I would highly recommend AS-OBGYN over any other program with which I am familiar.</p>

                                    The AS ultrasound reporting system has been an essential, core component of our US practice at the University of Louisville Department of OBGYN since 2003. Approximately 12 faculty members in our department use the reporting system for a full range of MFM, general OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology, and Fetal Echo reports. I do not recall a day when the AS system was down. Support is excellent and the software interfaces well with our recently installed Allscripts EMR.</p>

                                    We have been using the AS Software system in the greater Portland Metropolitan Area since 2007 serving thousands of patients in multiple hospitals. We are very pleased with the AS System. It is very user friendly and has improved our workflow and efficiency, allowing us to implement a state-of-the-art structured reporting system. The AS Software system is integrated into our enterprise environment and seamlessly interfaces with our Epic EMR, PACS, and Voice Recognition program. From upgrades to product support, the AS Software support team is very professional and has taken care of us while providing superior service and support. The AS System is an integral part of how we provide care today and into the future.</p>

                                    We looked at several other reporting solutions, but decided to go with AS Software due to the ease of use, features, and pricing. I have been involved with several software and EHR installation projects and expected some issues, but they were very minimal and were handled efficiently and professionally by both the hospital IT department and the AS group. I was very impressed with the technical support team that not only got us up and running, but were always available for questions or problem solving. The product has been very easy to learn and use. It has been a good teaching tool for both our OB residents and students as well as for our ultrasound students as well. It has made work a lot more efficient since we installed it. We are looking to also incorporate in our satellite clinics as well. AS Software has certainly worked as advertised and has been an excellent investment.</p>

                                    I support applications for the enterprise information services department, work with many different vendors, and have nothing but great things to say about AS Software. They have a knowledgeable staff who know our site's install base and are well-versed in the AS product line. They provided all requested documentation for our change control process and made our last version upgrade go very smoothly.</p>
